# LiveKit development runbook

This runbook starts the web MVP as independent development processes. It is a
single-demo-user setup, not an authentication design. `DEMO_USER_ID`,
development LiveKit tokens, and development binding keys must not be used for
multiuser or production wallet access.

## Privacy and retention contract

- The application persists no microphone audio, synthesized audio, or replayable recordings.
- Agent sessions use `record: false`; LiveKit Egress and automatic Egress stay disabled.
- Deepgram uses LiveKit Inference with `mip_opt_out=true` and the documented ZDR path.
- ElevenLabs logging is disabled only when the account's zero-retention capability has been verified. Otherwise provider defaults apply and may retain request history.
- Content-free phase counters and latency aggregates are safe to keep with normal operational telemetry.
- Native voice metrics are limited to the runtime label and aggregate connection, final-transcript, first-token, first-audio, interruption, recovery, and total-duration milestones.
- Detailed traces are disabled by default. Development traces require explicit `VOICE_TRACE_ENABLED=true`, are redacted before storage, and expire after no more than seven days.
- Production traces additionally require privacy approval, a retention destination, an audited access role, and a deletion mechanism. Raw audio, provider payloads, keys, addresses, names, tokens, amounts, and balances never belong in traces.

Review the LiveKit Cloud project before a test window. Confirm that Egress,
auto-Egress, room recording, and Agent Observability recording are disabled.
Record any remaining ElevenLabs retention limitation in the deployment notes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.18 or newer and npm.
- Supabase CLI 2.80.0 and Docker Desktop (on macOS, Colima also works — see the self-hosted LiveKit section below for the UDP port-forwarding note).
- A self-hosted LiveKit server started with `docker compose up -d livekit` (local default). A LiveKit Cloud development project is only needed for the documented Cloud alternative.
- An Ed25519 key pair generated outside the repository.

Generate a development key pair without committing it:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm Ed25519 -out /tmp/nani-live-private.pem
openssl pkey -in /tmp/nani-live-private.pem -pubout -out /tmp/nani-live-public.pem
```

## Configure the processes

From the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
cd apps/nana-wallet && npm ci && cd ../..
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/nana-wallet/.env.example apps/nana-wallet/.env.local
npx supabase start
npx supabase db reset
```

Put provider secrets in the root `.env`, never in a `VITE_*` variable:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
DEMO_USER_ID=11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111
WDK_TOOLS_SOURCE=fixture
AGENT_RUNTIME=deterministic
LIVE_VOICE_ENABLED=true
LIVE_VOICE_BINDING_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
LIVE_VOICE_BINDING_PUBLIC_KEY=-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
# Local default: self-hosted LiveKit from the compose stack.
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://localhost:7880
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=development-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=development-secret
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=development-provider-key
LIVEKIT_TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs
# Development fallback when the ElevenLabs account cannot use API voices:
# LIVEKIT_TTS_PROVIDER=inference
# LIVEKIT_TTS_MODEL=cartesia/sonic-3
# LIVEKIT_TTS_VOICE=5c5ad5e7-1020-476b-8b91-fdcbe9cc313c
LIVEKIT_RECORDING_ENABLED=false
AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_RECORDING=false
LIVEKIT_AGENT_RUNTIME=service-adapter
VOICE_TRACE_ENABLED=false
VOICE_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS=7
```

The API needs the private binding key to issue grants. The worker receives the
public key and refuses to start without its LiveKit credentials, database
identity, and ElevenLabs credential. `readApiProcessConfig` and
`readWorkerProcessConfig` reject malformed values before a process starts.

In the wallet `.env.local`, configure only public development values:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_AGENT_BACKEND=1
# Default (local): the browser asks our own API for the room token.
VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SOURCE=local
# Cloud-only: required under VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SOURCE=cloud, ignored under local.
# VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SERVER_ID=your-development-token-server-id
VITE_LIVEKIT_AGENT_NAME=nani-agent
VITE_LIVEKIT_PARTICIPANT_IDENTITY=11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111
```

With the default `VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SOURCE=local`, the browser calls
`POST /v1/voice/room-token` after binding the conversation and connects with
the returned short-lived, room-scoped token; `VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SERVER_ID`
is not needed. The Cloud path remains an explicit alternative: set
`VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SOURCE=cloud` and configure
`VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SERVER_ID` to keep the legacy LiveKit Cloud development
token server flow byte-for-byte. On both paths the browser verifies that the
token identity matches `VITE_LIVEKIT_PARTICIPANT_IDENTITY` before
    connecting. The signed Fastify binding remains the worker's application
    identity check.

## Self-hosted LiveKit (default local)

The local default is a self-hosted LiveKit server managed by the same compose
stack as PostgreSQL. The server, API, and worker share one credential pair:
`LIVEKIT_API_KEY` / `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` from the root `.env` are read by the
API and worker directly, and the compose service injects the same pair into the
LiveKit server via `LIVEKIT_KEYS`. One key, three processes — no Cloud project
required.

Start the server before the API and worker:

```bash
docker compose up -d livekit
docker compose ps livekit   # wait for the healthcheck to report healthy
```

The container publishes only loopback ports (`127.0.0.1:7880` signaling,
`7881/udp` and `60000-60100/udp` media) and `docker/livekit.yaml` contains no
egress, recording, or webhook sections — their absence is the auditable privacy
guarantee, and the privacy and retention contract above is unchanged. `LIVEKIT_URL`
stays `ws://localhost:7880` in the root `.env`.

macOS notes:

- Docker Desktop works out of the box. With Colima, UDP port forwarding can be
  flaky; start Colima with an explicit forwarded port range, e.g.
  `colima start --port-range 60000-60100`, if media does not flow.
- If the browser connects but audio is one-way, check that `7881/udp` and the
  `60000-60100/udp` range actually reach the container (`docker compose port
  livekit 7881/udp`).

Hosting notes:

- The API and worker must reach the same server the browser uses. Running the
  API on a different host than the browser? Set `LIVEKIT_URL` on that host to a
  URL the browser can reach (and loopback-only publishing will no longer apply
  — prefer keeping everything on one machine for development).
- Room tokens are short-lived (`LIVEKIT_ROOM_TOKEN_TTL`, default 600 seconds,
  minimum 60). If a live session outlives its token, live voice fails with a
  connection error: stop live voice and start it again to fetch a fresh token.

Then run the normal flow: `npm run livekit:dev` registers the agent against the
local server, start the API and the web app (see "Start independently" below),
and exercise one non-financial turn and one financial preview→confirm turn.

### Cloud alternative

To use LiveKit Cloud instead of the local server, set `LIVEKIT_URL` to your
`wss://<project>.livekit.cloud` URL and the matching Cloud credentials in the
root `.env`, and set `VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SOURCE=cloud` plus
`VITE_LIVEKIT_TOKEN_SERVER_ID` in the wallet `.env.local`. The Cloud dev token
server then issues the browser's room token; the local self-hosted path above is
the default and requires no Cloud account.

### Optional smoke e2e against the local server

The provider-backed smoke can run against the self-hosted server:

```bash
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://localhost:7880 \
LIVEKIT_E2E=1 \
LIVEKIT_AGENT_RUNTIME=native-livekit \
LIVEKIT_E2E_AGENT_NAME=nani \
LIVEKIT_E2E_BINDING_TOKEN='short-lived-token' \
LIVEKIT_E2E_BINDING_PUBLIC_KEY='public-key-pem' \
npm run test:e2e:livekit-smoke
```

## Arc Testnet wallet provider (optional)

For a real-funds demo you can replace the WDK wallet path with Circle
developer-controlled wallets on Arc Testnet by setting
`WDK_TOOLS_SOURCE=circle-arc` in the root `.env`:

```dotenv
WDK_TOOLS_SOURCE=circle-arc
WDK_NETWORK=arc-testnet
WDK_TOKEN=USDC
CIRCLE_API_KEY=TEST_API_KEY:id:secret
CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET=64-hex-entity-secret
CIRCLE_SENDER_WALLET_ID=circle-wallet-uuid
WDK_MAX_TRANSFER_AMOUNT=0.05
WDK_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS=0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```

Provider selection summary: `fixture` is the safe default, `live` routes
through the bundled WDK MCP process on Sepolia/USDT, and `circle-arc` builds
the Circle provider on Arc Testnet at boot — missing credentials or a
mismatched `WDK_NETWORK`/`WDK_TOKEN` refuse the boot (`CircleArcConfigError`),
and there is no silent fallback to fixture mode.

Trust model and boundary: Circle holds the wallet keys server-side under the
developer entity; the backend holds the entity secret (never logged, never
sent to the client); the user's device never signs. Arc TESTNET only —
chain id 5042002, USDC only, no mainnet configuration. The live transfer
policy variables are mandatory: circle-arc transfers fail closed with
`policy_rejected` when `WDK_MAX_TRANSFER_AMOUNT` or `WDK_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS`
is absent or invalid.

Real-USDC consent warning: running the manual end-to-end exercise moves
real testnet USDC through Circle and the Arc testnet RPC and requires the
operator's explicit consent. The numbered consent-first steps live in
`docs/local-live-runbook.md` ("Arc Testnet (Circle developer-controlled
wallet)" → "Manual E2E").

`/health` note: under circle-arc the response keeps its legacy fields
(`mode: live`, `network: arc-testnet`, `mcp`, `wallet`) and may include the
additive optional `provider` object (`status: healthy | degraded |
unavailable`, plus a credential-free `reason` when unhealthy). `/health` is
not a `/v1` route; `docs/api.md` is intentionally untouched and no `/v1`
request/response shape changed.

## Live voice architecture

Live voice is one OpenAI Realtime speech-to-speech session
(`OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL`, default `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini`; `OPENAI_REALTIME_VOICE`,
default `marin`). The session is created in the worker from `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
started with `record: false`. There is no separate STT/TTS/VAD step and no
`WalletConversationLLM`: transcription, inference, and speech generation occur
inside the Realtime model session.

The worker builds a per-binding `WalletConversationService` after the
`bind_conversation` gate succeeds. Its recipient-memory runtime scopes to the
binding user (`binding.sub`), never the demo tenant — this is the REVIEW FIX V3
wiring that makes `isClaimedRecipientValid` revalidate versioned recipients. The
worker shares the repository, wallet, and `FinancialTaskRegistry` with that
per-binding service, so the voice tools and the frontend Confirm/Cancel card
arbitrate on the same database claim.

Five model-facing realtime tools are exposed by `createRealtimeTools`:

- `get_balance` — reads the configured wallet balance via `WalletProvider`.
- `search_contacts` — searches `RecipientMemoryService` scoped per binding user
  (`binding.sub`); returns address-free candidates, fails closed when memory is
  unavailable.
- `send_token` — preview-only. Its strict zod schema accepts only
  `{ amount, recipientId, recipientVersion, memo? }` and rejects any unknown field,
  so a model can never pass `dryRun`, a free-form `to` address, network, token, or
  wallet. It delegates to the service's `previewTransfer`.
- `confirm_transfer` / `cancel_transfer` — call `resolveDecision` with the
  *current* persisted `previewId`, so a superseded or cancelled preview fails
  closed to `stale_preview` instead of broadcasting.

A preview is persisted through the PostgreSQL repository as a `pendingTransfer`
on `conversation_state` plus a row in `conversation_transfer_attempts`. The unique
partial index `conversation_one_active_transfer_idx` allows at most one active
transfer per conversation. The worker subscribes to `financialTasks` state
revisions and publishes `conversation_state_changed` data (topic
`conversation_state_changed`) to the participant so the frontend Confirm/Cancel
card appears without publish logic in the LiveKit tool layer.

## Native runtime selector

`LIVEKIT_AGENT_RUNTIME` is retained as worker configuration (`service-adapter` by
default, or `native-livekit`) so the native LiveKit eval tooling and server code
that read `readLiveKitAgentRuntime` keep compiling. It does not change how the
worker composes its session: the worker always builds the single OpenAI Realtime
speech-to-speech session above. The worker rejects unsupported runtime values and
never falls back silently.

Keep the legacy bridge decision gates (fixture runtime parity, privacy-safe
metrics review, native cloud smoke, and browser manual verification) as
read-only evidence for the retained runtime selector; they are not replaceable
with fixture tests because they exercise room dispatch, media, and client
lifecycle boundaries.

## Start independently

Use three terminals from the repository root:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Fastify HTTP boundary
npm run dev
```

```bash
# Terminal 2: LiveKit worker
npm run livekit:dev
```

```bash
# Terminal 3: wallet web app
cd apps/nana-wallet
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8083
```

Open `http://localhost:8083`, tap Nani, and complete a nonfinancial Spanish
or English turn. The browser publishes the microphone before it binds the
conversation so the agent input stream receives the first track. The screen
receives canonical financial revisions from Fastify, not financial payloads
from room data.

For a native-runtime verification window, keep Fastify and the web app running
and start the worker with:

```bash
LIVEKIT_AGENT_RUNTIME=native-livekit npm run livekit:dev
```

## Safe verification commands

Run deterministic checks without Cloud, WDK, model, or provider credentials:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:simulation
npm run test:retention
npm --prefix apps/nana-wallet run lint
npm --prefix apps/nana-wallet run typecheck
npm --prefix apps/nana-wallet test
npm --prefix apps/nana-wallet run build
npm --prefix apps/nana-wallet run build:mobile
```

The provider-backed smoke is deliberately opt-in and does not call wallet
tools or move funds:

```bash
LIVEKIT_E2E=1 \
LIVEKIT_AGENT_RUNTIME=native-livekit \
LIVEKIT_E2E_AGENT_NAME=nani \
LIVEKIT_E2E_BINDING_TOKEN='short-lived-token' \
LIVEKIT_E2E_BINDING_PUBLIC_KEY='public-key-pem' \
npm run test:e2e:livekit-smoke
```

The command fails closed when any required input is missing. A successful
smoke creates and deletes a temporary room, dispatches the configured agent,
and verifies the binding purpose, audience, issuer, and signature. It never
sets `WDK_ALLOW_BROADCAST` or `WDK_BROADCAST_APPROVED`.

## Native cloud and browser verification

Run the smoke with a separately running native-runtime worker. It verifies
cloud room dispatch and binding only; it does not publish wallet audio or
invoke wallet tools.

During a native test window, use a real browser room to verify a normal voice
turn, barge-in, reconnect recovery, typed fallback, preview cancellation,
preview confirmation, uncertain broadcast display, and end-live teardown.
Review the metrics snapshot or configured telemetry export after the window:
it may contain aggregate timing keys prefixed by `native-livekit.` and
counters, but no room ID, participant ID, transcript, address, amount, tool
arguments, receipt, or provider payload.

For a bound room in development or test mode, the worker also exposes the
content-free `get_voice_metrics` RPC to that same participant. It is not
registered in production and returns only the aggregate snapshot above.

Also exercise the unchanged room protocol from an Android-capable client or
SDK harness: `bind_conversation`, `interrupt_agent`, the
`conversation_state_changed` packet, canonical HTTP refresh, and disconnect.
These checks remain required before retiring `WalletConversationLLM`.

## Shutdown and incident handling

Send SIGTERM or stop the worker with `Ctrl-C`. The worker stops accepting new
jobs, waits up to `LIVEKIT_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` for registered financial tasks,
then closes wallet providers and PostgreSQL. Room interruption or worker
shutdown never cancels a transfer after its database claim. A task that misses
the deadline remains in a durable `broadcasting` or `uncertain` state and must
be reconciled from transaction evidence; do not replay it.

For fixture runs, inspect the canonical state after shutdown and confirm that
an uncertain result blocks another financial action. For live WDK tests, keep
the existing explicit gates: `WDK_LIVE=1`, and additionally
`WDK_ALLOW_BROADCAST=1` plus `WDK_BROADCAST_APPROVED=1` for the separately
approved broadcast harness. Lock the dedicated limited-funds Sepolia wallet
after every live window.

## Production gap

Before multiuser production access, replace `DEMO_USER_ID` with a validated
bearer identity provider, issue LiveKit tokens from Fastify, rotate binding
keys with an overlap procedure, add authorization tests, rate limits, abuse
controls, and a reviewed trace deletion workflow. Development credentials and
this runbook do not provide those guarantees.
