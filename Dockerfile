# NOTE: NODE_ENV is intentionally NOT set here. The API config
# (src/config/process.ts) treats NODE_ENV=production as a hard gate that also
# requires DATABASE_URL + DEMO_USER_ID + LIVE_VOICE_BINDING_PRIVATE_KEY. The
# local compose dev flow must NOT hit that gate; the same image becomes
# production-ready when those vars are provided by a deployment.

# Production dependencies only. `npm ci --omit=dev` is a clean, reproducible
# install in the runtime base image (same linux/x64 arch as the build stage).
# The native prod modules here ship prebuilt binaries, so no toolchain is needed:
#   - @huggingface/transformers -> onnxruntime-node (prebuilt .node per platform)
#   - @livekit/agents -> @livekit/local-inference (platform optionalDependencies)
#   - sharp (transitive) -> @img/sharp-* prebuilt binaries
# The install still needs network at build time to fetch those prebuilt binaries.
# better-sqlite3 is a DEV-ONLY transitive dependency (pulled in by `evalite`,
# marked `dev: true` in package-lock.json); it is not needed by the production
# runtime and is therefore not installed here.
